## How to create your author profile

Create a file under the member directory [_members](https://github.com/csz-academy/csz.academy/tree/main/_members) with your acronym as filename. Then add a frontmatter with your personal information.

```md
---
type: member
acronym: <<acronym>>
display_name: <<displaynam>>
roles: ["author"] <-- Your Roles in this project, can also be "architect" or similar
github: <<github username>>
web: <<Your HomePage>>
---

<<Your Profile Page Content>>
```

## Markup Features

You are free to use LaTeX within your Markup files. Support for rendering comes from [https://www.mathjax.org/].
For a better integration we're making this feature opt-in. Add the follwing property to your post front-matter.
```md
---
features: [ "latex" ]
---
```
Now you can use Latex Notation in your post like this:
```
$$ \LaTeX $$
```

## Directory Structure

### Posts
Every post is a single unit which contains all markup- and asset files.
At a minimum you create the following structure
```
_posts/
└── <<Year>>-<<Month>>-<<Day>>-<<post-title>>/
    └── <<Year>>-<<Month>>-<<Day>>-<<post-title>>.MARKUP
```

#### Using Assets

Drop the assets next to your post:
```
<<Year>>-<<Month>>-<<Day>>-<<post-title>>/
├── archive.zip
├── image.png
└── <<Year>>-<<Month>>-<<Day>>-<<post-title>>.MARKUP
```
And you can link them in your post like this:
