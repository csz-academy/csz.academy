Hello, World!

This is an example page that won't be published. Its only purpose is testing layouts.

Run Jekyll with `--drafts` switch to build it.

[this is an asset](hello-world.txt)

You can also use $$\LaTeX$$ in your posts. For example, you can do fancy math stuff like this:

$$c = \pm\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$

$$L' = {L}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$

$$
y = a + f(b x)
  = a + f(\underbrace{b x}_{\mathclap{\ge 0 \text{ by assumption}}})
$$

Just add `features: [ "latex" ]` to the YAML metadata block of your post.
